// What this server has been asked for, counted rather than logged.
//
// A departure board wants to answer a few operational questions — which landings are actually
// dialled up, whether a route is erroring, whether the board is getting slower — and every ordinary
// way of answering them costs more hardware than the board itself. An access log grows without
// bound and needs rotating; a hosted analytics tag is blocked outright by this server's own
// Content-Security-Policy; a self-hosted one wants a database and half a gigabyte of RAM.
//
// So: fixed keys, integer counts, held in a Map. The set of keys is bounded by the routes this
// server has and the landings it was built with, so memory is flat no matter how long it runs and
// however much traffic it takes. Counting a request costs a Map increment and touches no disk.
//
// What is counted here is only ever the recent delta. Every few minutes it is handed to
// lib/stats-store.js, which folds it into an hourly bucket and owns the long history — so this file
// stays small and synchronous, and the question "when" is answered somewhere that can afford it.
//
// It counts requests, not people. There is no identifier here, nothing per-visitor, and no record
// of the order anything happened in: a counter cannot reconstruct a journey, which on a public
// kiosk is a feature and on a phone is the point.
