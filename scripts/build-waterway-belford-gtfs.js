// Builds gtfs/waterway-belford/ from NY Waterway's printed Belford timetable: the weekday sheet
// effective 8 September 2026 and the weekend sheet effective 12 September 2026.
//
// Why this is not in gtfs/waterway/:
//
//   gtfs/waterway/ is a Trillium download and the board's contract for it is "drop in a fresh copy
//   when NY Waterway publishes one". The copy bundled today has no Belford stop, no Belford route
//   and a calendar that lapses 20261001, so a new download is due within weeks — and it would
//   silently erase anything hand-written into those files. A transcription that can be quietly
//   deleted by a routine feed refresh is worse than no transcription, so this route gets its own
//   directory and its own PARTNER_FEEDS entry, the way gtfs/ikea/ does for the other NY Waterway
//   boat the operator leaves out of its GTFS.
//
//   When NY Waterway does publish Belford in the download, this whole feed should be deleted and
//   its landings.json keys with it. The stop ids below are deliberately the operator's own real
//   ids so that day is a deletion and not a migration.
//
// Run with: node scripts/build-waterway-belford-gtfs.js
//
// !! This is a TRANSCRIPTION, not a download. Nothing can diff it against the operator for you.
// !! When NY Waterway publishes a new sheet, re-read it and update the tables below and the dates.
//
// Reading the source:
//
//   The weekday sheet prints a MORNING PEAK PERIOD table headed "Depart Belford" with the four
//   Manhattan/Jersey City columns headed "Arrive", and an EVENING PEAK PERIOD table headed the
//   other way. That is taken literally, as it is for Seastreak in scripts/build-seastreak-gtfs.js:
//   an "Arrive" call is drop-off only and never advertises a boarding. The evening table heads its
//   last column "Depart Belford", but Belford is the end of the run there, so it is an arrival like
//   the rest — a boarding on a trip's final call would be a boat you could get on and never off.
//
//   THE "PIER 79 VIA TRANSFER AT PIER 11" ROWS. Four rows carry that note, and on them the Pier 79
//   end of the journey is a different vessel. The morning gives it away by the clock: the 05:45
//   from Belford is printed as Pier 11 06:25, Brookfield 06:40, Paulus Hook 06:50 and Midtown
//   06:50, and no boat is at Paulus Hook and Midtown in the same minute. Pier 11 06:25 to Midtown
//   06:50 is twenty-five minutes, which is the existing Pier 11 - Midtown/W 39th run in the
//   downloaded feed. So the note qualifies the column it names and only that column: on those rows
//   the Pier 79 call is dropped here, because it is a connection the rider makes at Pier 11 on a
//   boat gtfs/waterway/ already carries. Transcribing it would advertise one sailing twice.
//
//   The intermediate calls on those rows are NOT dropped. The note names Pier 79, the clock places
//   every other call on the through boat, and dropping Brookfield would take real boardings off a
//   pier this board watches.
//
//   THE ROWS THAT DO NOT RUN ALL WEEK. Two rows carry a day note in the Service Notes column and
//   are transcribed exactly as printed: the 05:15 from Belford is "Tuesday - Thursday" and the
//   18:15 from Pier 79 is "Tuesday - Friday". Neither runs on a Monday. That is easy to miss on the
//   sheet — the notes column sits well right of the times it qualifies — and easy to talk yourself
//   out of, because NY Waterway's own GTFS carries a "(MTuWTh)" service on other routes and these
//   look like they should match it. They do not. The paper is the source; read the notes column.
//
//   THE WEEKEND SHEET is a different route rather than the weekday one thinned out: Belford, Pier
//   11, Brookfield and Midtown only, with no Paulus Hook call and no transfer rows. It prints
//   Brookfield as "WFC" on the evening table and "Brookfield" on the daytime one; both are the same
//   pier, landing 25. It starts on the Saturday after the weekday sheet, which is the date printed
//   on it.
//
// !! Seastreak ran Belford until 4 September 2026 and its transcription still carries those
// !! sailings under a service that ends on that date. See scripts/build-seastreak-gtfs.js.
