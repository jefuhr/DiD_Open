// Everything NYC Ferry that this repository knows and no published feed told it.
//
// The board is built from GTFS, but a lot of what makes it useful is in no GTFS at all: which boat
// works which trip, when a crew changes over and where, where the boats sleep overnight, and the
// thresholds used to infer a boat going out of service. That knowledge is spread across config/,
// content/ and a few module constants — the right place for it to live, and a poor place to read
// it from if you are not this program.
//
// This gathers it into one JSON file with its provenance attached, so it can be handed to someone,
// diffed across a schedule change, or checked against the operator without anyone reading
// JavaScript. It is a snapshot for export, never an input: nothing in the build reads it back, and
// editing it changes nothing. Edit the sources named in each section's `source` field.
//
// NYC Ferry only. The partner operators that share these docks — NY Waterway, Seastreak, NYU
// Langone, Liberty Landing, the IKEA boat and the Trust's Governors Island boats — each have their
// own hand-maintained corrections and transcribed timetables in this repository, and none of it is
// here. Their stop ids and their on/off switches are stripped out of the two config files that
// carry them, so what remains is NYC Ferry's own.
//
